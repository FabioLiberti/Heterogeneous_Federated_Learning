Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which machine learning models are trained decentralized on distributed devices or servers, without the need to share sensitive data.     
Here are the high-level steps to develop a Federated Learning system using Python and TensorFlow as an example:

# 1. Data collection:

Initially, collect data from distributed sources. For example, if you are developing a machine learning app on mobile devices, data can be generated or collected locally on each device.

# 2. Data preparation:

Make sure data is pre-processed consistently across all devices. Data cleansing, normalization, and transformation must be performed consistently.

# 3. Global model definition:

Create a global machine learning model that will be used as a reference model.    
This model is initialized in a common way across all participating devices.

# 4. Data splitting and local training:

Split data across each device in a way that reflects the overall model architecture.     
Train the model locally on each device using local data. You can use TensorFlow or another machine learning framework for this step.

# 5. Local model aggregation:

After local training, the local models are aggregated into a single global model.     
Aggregation can occur in various ways, such as averaging local model weights.

# 6. Global model reinforcement:

The updated global model is sent back to each participating device for further local training iterations.     
This iterative update process continues until the model achieves good performance.

# 7. Model Rating:

Evaluate the performance of the federated model on validation or test data.     
Measure metrics like accuracy, loss, etc.

# 8. Security and privacy implementation:

Make sure the system respects the privacy and security of participant data.      
You may need to use techniques such as encryption or removal of sensitive data.

# 9. Scalability and communications management:

Manage communication between devices or servers and ensure the system is scalable for a growing number of participants.

# 10. Documentation and testing:

Document your Federated Learning system thoroughly and test it thoroughly to ensure it works properly.     
Below is a simplified example of Python code using TensorFlow Federated (TFF), a framework for Federated Learning:
